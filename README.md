# Loan Default Predictor

[Loan Default Predictor](https://loan-default-predictor-0ouz.onrender.com) is a machine learning project that aims to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default. Using a dataset of financial and demographic features, the model can predict the probability of defaulting. The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Itâ€™s built using Python with tools like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to support more informed lending decisions with a simple, explainable prediction interface.
