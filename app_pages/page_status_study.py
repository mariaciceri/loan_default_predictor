we can see that:
* The default status appears to occur at lower upfront charges.
* There is no data available for defaulted loans in the Interest Rate Spread 
feature, as it is missing for those instances. This absence may suggest that
the individuals who defaulted did not provide this value, which could explain
why the plot shows data only for non-defaulted individuals. Despite this,
the model still considers this feature important, possibly because it is 
handled differently during training (such as imputation or exclusion).
* All credit types from EQUI (Equifax) have defaulted, in contrast to the 
other three categories, where approximately 1/5 of the cases are default.
* The defaulted loans tend to have a slightly higher median rate of 
interest than non-defaulted loans, between 3 and 5.
* The defaulted loans tend to have a larger IOR (between 30 and 50) compared 
to non-defaulted loans, indicating a wider spread of values, 
which might suggest a more varied debt-to-income ratio among those who default.
